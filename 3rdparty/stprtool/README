Programming conventions
=======================

Class labels
------------
Two-class classification methods. The first (positive) class is 
represented by +1. The negative (second) class by anything else
than 1. That, is -1 or 2 should work. 

Multiclass labels are represented by natural numbers 1,2,...,maxClass.


Variable naming conventions
----------------------------

Structures     : Model
Other varibles : N, M, covType

List of frequently used variable names:

X           [N x M] ... feature vectors
Y or labels [M x 1] ... labels

N / nDim      ... dimension of feature vector; 
M / nExamples ... number of examples

cov        ... covariance matrix
meanVec    ... mean vector
C          ... SVM regularization constant
kernelName ... string containing kernel name
kernelArgs ... kernel arguments 

numPos       ... number of positive examples
numNeg       ... number of negative examples
priorPos 
classCondPos 
classCondNeg
