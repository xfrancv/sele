	* Implemented svmocas_kernel.m
	* Functions in ./kernels/ polished to comply with the STPRtool programming conventions.

	* DBL_MAX and INT_MAX removed from bsvm2.c; it caused problems during compilation on
	some Windows machines.

	* fixed problem with Init_centers in cmeans.m; this argument was ignored; now
	it is used as the initial solution; pointed out by Sauptik Dhar <dharx007@umn.edu>

	* bsvm2_mec.c and bsvm2.m made more readable. There was a mismatch
	in the formula for computing Alphas compared to what we have in our paper.
	Now, it the fomulas in c-code and the paper corespond.

	* fixed problem with computing radius in minball.m; the bug
	was pointed out by Daewon Lee <daewon@tuebingen.mpg.de>
